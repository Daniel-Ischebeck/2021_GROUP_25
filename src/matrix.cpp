//Matrix.cpp - Best

//Some comments / thoughts

// You will want constructors for different standard matricies 
// some examples are where diagonals are 1, rest 0, (gets used in some operations)
// all zeros etc.

//how do we want to store data in matrix, array, std::vector (be careful to avoid confusion with Vector3d)
