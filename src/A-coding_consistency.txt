Use format within visual studio - right click > format document

camelCase for variable names

class names are capital, e.g. Model

classes, public then private.

make sure to initalise your variables. They don't default to zero!!!!

Conditional statements, put braces on new line, helps with debugging and avoids silly mistakes
e.g. 
if(some condition)
{
    doSomething();
}

comments - everywhere. Anyone in the group should be able to read you code and understand whats going on.
comments - function arguments etc. like in software CW.

accessor functions - should be formatted      get_variableName()

If your accessor only returns one thing, use the one line format:     int Model::get_numVectors() { return this->numVectors; }




Some things to remember:
Passing by reference
Const arguments so we donâ€™t accidently change data
error checking where sensible
if allocating memory dynamically, freeing it after use
