Use format within visual studio - right click > format document

camelCase for variable names

class names are capital, e.g. Model

classes, private data then public data.

make sure to initalise your variables. They don't default to zero!!!!

comments - everywhere. Anyone in the group should be able to read you code and understand whats going on.
comments - function arguments etc. like in software CW.

accessor functions - should be formatted      get_variableName()

Some things to remember:
Passing by reference
Const arguments so we donâ€™t accidently change data
error checking where sensible
if allocating memory dynamically, freeing it after use
